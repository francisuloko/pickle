      White Word Cells is a word store app that lets users store
      words with a custom description.

      It is modelled after the white blood cells which form
      part of the body&apos;s immune system to help fight infections and other diseases.

      The aim is for users to store personalized affirmations or motivational
      quotes to help them stay positive when they feel low.
